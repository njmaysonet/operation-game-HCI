UCF CAP4104 Group 26 "Operation" Game Fall 2016
-----------------------------------------------

This project was created for demonstration and presentation purposes for the Fall 2016 Human-Computer Interaction class at UCF by Group 26 which I was a part of.

As I do not remember my classmates unfortunately, I cannot give credit at this moment to them but I did receive help in regards to maze creation and other assets.

Most of the game logic is my code. Unity 5 and C# scripting were used.
